# Power BI Custom Visual Development
This repository contains the source code and resources for a custom visual development project for Power BI. The custom visual includes four types of charts: column chart, bar chart, stacked column chart, and stacked bar chart, as well as a legend for data representation. This visual is built using TypeScript, D3.js and Power BI Visual SDKs and APIs. It is not an official Power BI visual. 

## Charts and Additional Features

### Column Chart Visualization


The Column Chart is a traditional chart that displays data as vertical bars. This chart is effective for comparing values across categories.


### Bar Chart Visualization


The Bar Chart is similar to the Column Chart but displays data as horizontal bars. It is useful when you have long category labels.


### Stacked Column Chart Visualization.


The Stacked Column Chart allows you to stack data series on top of each other. It is excellent for showing the composition of a category across different attributes.


### Stacked Bar Chart Visualisation.


The Stacked Bar Chart is similar to the Stacked Column Chart but displays data as horizontal bars. It is useful for visualizing the composition of categories in a horizontal orientation.


### Legend 


It helps users understand which colors or patterns correspond to specific data series or categories.


### Supports various data sources and transformations.
